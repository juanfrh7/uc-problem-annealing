    "# Benchmark\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter notebook, our primary objective is to thoroughly benchmark and compare the performance of our quantum annealing-based optimization problem with that of a classical implementation. This benchmarking process will provide us with valuable insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of the quantum algorithm in solving our specific problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals of Benchmarking:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Cost Comparison and Visualization:** One of the fundamental aspects of our benchmarking process involves plotting and visually comparing the cost or objective function values obtained from both the quantum annealing and classical implementations. This visual comparison will allow us to quickly assess whether the quantum approach is providing improvements over classical methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Relative Error Calculation:** To quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of our quantum annealing results, we will calculate the relative error for the commitment variable 'x' and 'y'. This step involves comparing the commitment values obtained from the quantum solution with those from the classical approach. By calculating the relative error, we can understand the degree of variation between the two methods and gain insights into the precision of our quantum algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.Scalability Testing:** To gauge the scalability of the quantum algorithm, we can gradually increase the size of the optimization problem (e.g., the number of generators or time periods) and observe how both implementations handle larger instances of the problem. This scalability testing will provide insights into the algorithm's efficiency as problem complexity grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.Statistical Analysis:** Conducting a comprehensive statistical analysis of the results obtained from multiple runs of the quantum algorithm can provide a clearer understanding of its performance characteristics. Analyzing metrics such as mean, standard deviation, and distribution of results can help us make informed decisions about the algorithm's reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.Impact of Problem Parameters:** Explore the impact of varying problem parameters (such as constraints or costs) on the performance of both the quantum and classical implementations. This analysis can uncover scenarios where one approach outperforms the other and guide us in selecting the most suitable algorithm for specific problem instances."
